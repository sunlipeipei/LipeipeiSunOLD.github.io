                                <p><h3>The Question and Objective</h3>
                                    <p>The final project's objective is to analyze and optimize the layout of wall panels and windows on a building facade,
                                    incorporating both performance requirements and aesthetic preferences. The project will employ discrete mathematics,
                                    with a focus on combinatorics and probability, to systematically explore layout options. The guiding question of this
                                    project is:</p>
                                    <p>"What are the optimized building façade layout options based on the building information provided below?"
                                    <h4>Basic Building Façade Requirements:</h4>

                                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>The scope of this project involves two main stages: analyzing combinations per vertical bay and then applying these
                                    findings to the entire wall area.</p>
                                    <p><h4>Step 1. Total Combination for Vertical Bay</h4>
                                    The initial step involved calculating the number of wall panel layout combinations available per vertical bay,
                                    considering panel heights of 3, 6, and 9 feet, along with 12- and 15-foot windows.
                                    Based on the 3, 6, 9 feet solid panels, 12- and 15-feet windows, and a 54 feet total building height, 141 combinations
                                    were identified. This calculation uses Module 5 Combination knowledge from discrete math class. See image below for the
                                    representation of the 141 options.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/02_Panel Layout/Picture02.png" alt="Matplotlib graph showing building façade panel layout" /></a>
                                    <p>Image: Matplotlib graph showing building façade panel layout – vertical bay options</p>
                                
                                    <p>Upon determining the total combinations, the next step was to refine these options. Although there were 141 options for
                                    vertical bays, many did not align with aesthetic preferences favoring 6-foot and 9-foot panels with a maximum of two 3’
                                    panels between windows. Additionally, options with more than 3 windows in a vertical bay exceeded the maximum allowable
                                    windows (one 12’ window at Level 1 and one 15’ window at Levels 2 and 3). Consequently, options not meeting these
                                    criteria were eliminated.</p>
                                    <p>After this elimination, there were 15 valid options. The next stage involved arranging each vertical bay layout using
                                    Module 5 permutation knowledge. This involved looping through each vertical bay and performing permutation calculations
                                    to generate different arrangements based on the basic panel and window options. During this process, we ensured that the
                                    window heights were shown at the correct elevations of 0, 15, and 33 feet and filtered out the invalid options.</p>
                                    <p>As a result, from the 15 combination options, 113 valid options were generated for the vertical bays.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/02_Panel Layout/Picture03.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    Image: Matplotlib graph showing the 15 combination and 113 vertical bay options<br />
                                    
                                    <p><h4>Step 2. Combination at Full Building Extent</h4></p>
                                    <p>Now with the valid vertical bay options, I worked on combining the vertical bays to create the full building layouts.
                                    The evaluation of these layouts was guided by performance requirements, particularly the window-to-wall ratio. If this
                                    ratio falls outside the 35%-40% range, those options were disregarded. Additionally, to ensure well-lit spaces, we aimed
                                    for an even distribution of windows at every level. For aesthetic integrity, layouts with more than two adjacent windows
                                    were excluded.</p>
                                    <p>However, as I started my analysis, I realized that arranging 113 vertical bay options into a 42-bay building facade is a
                                    very complex task, especially if we are considering all possible combinations. The permutations for this scenario were
                                    extraordinarily high (113^42 if each bay can be used more than once, or 113! / (113-42)! if each bay can be used only
                                    once). It seemed infeasible to generate and evaluate all permutations.</p>
                                    <p>After knowing that generating all the options was not practical, to move forward with the analysis, instead of providing
                                    all the possible combinations, I used a few methods to provide directions for further analysis.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h5>Method 1 – Simplifying the Combination Analysis & Finding Patterns</h5></p>
                                    <p>For this method, I started by reviewing the glazing requirements and identifying how many windows were required at each
                                    level. To simplify the analysis, I chose to start with the highest window quality for each level, which would provide
                                    the best daylight for the interior space.</p>
                                    <p>First, the 113 valid options were divided into two categories, one with windows and one without. Then the options with
                                    windows were further broken down into seven categories:</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/02_Panel Layout/Picture04.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    <p>Image: categories of vertical bays with windows</p>
                                    <p>Based on the requirements that windows should be evenly distributed and the window quantity required, the options were
                                    studied.</p>
                                    <p>Option A involved alternating bays with 3 windows at each level and bays with all solid panels. This option would allow
                                    for even distribution of windows. Since level 1 requires 21 windows and level 2 and 3 only require 20 windows, an option
                                    with a window at Level 1 was also included.</p>
                                    <p>Image: Matplotlib graph showing samples from Option A</p>
                                    <p>Option B incorporated three types of window bays for window placement across levels. The three types of window bays
                                    include bays with windows at Level 2 only, bays with windows at Level 1 and 3, as well as bays with windows at Level 1
                                    only. This option provided layouts with a slightly different pattern where we have alternating windows that do not
                                    always land at the same location on each level. See image on the following page for a few sample outcomes.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/02_Panel Layout/Picture05.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    <p>Image: Matplotlib graph showing samples from Option B</p>
                                    <p>Option C, aimed for layout variation using all window bay types, arranged to ensure even distribution and adherence to
                                    the two-window adjacency rule. See image below for a few sample outcomes.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="immages/02_Panel Layout/Picture06.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    <p>Image: Matplotlib graph showing samples from Option C</p>
                                    <p>Through the process, a few different patterns were introduced based on the known requirements. Though these options did
                                    not cover all the possible scenarios, they provided architect designers and clients with a few different directions as a
                                    starting point. Based on feedback and preferences, variations within options could be furthered analyzed and studied.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><h5>Method 2 – Incremental Analysis</h5></p>
                                    <p>The second method involved breaking the façade into smaller, more manageable modules for analysis and then build up the
                                    full façade. With 42 bays, we could break it down into a few options: two 21-bay modules, three 14-bay modules, six
                                    7-bay modules, seven 6-bay modules, fourteen 3-bay modules and twenty-one 2-bay modules. In this scenario, instead of
                                    creating combinations for 42 bays, we started with a smaller module that is more manageable. The following analysis was
                                    based on the 2-bay module. To standardize the module type, 20 windows at each level were chosen for the study.</p>
                                    <p>Option D utilized a solid bay and a window bay with windows on all three levels as the 2-bay module. To compose 42 bays,
                                    we would have twenty 2-bay modules that provide 20 windows on each level, then two of the solid panel bays. This
                                    approach resulted in a very standard and repetitive layout. See image below for a few samples.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Image: Matplotlib graph showing samples from Option D</p>
                                    <p>Option E introduced variations in the 2-bay module, contributing to more interesting layouts.</p>
                                    <p>If the goal is to have one window on each level in the 2-bay module, there were a few more options:<br/>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>bay with window on level 1, 2, 3 and bay with all solid panels</li>
                                        <li>bay with window on level 1 + bay with window on level 2 & 3</li>
                                        <li>bay with window on level 2 + bay with window on level 1 & 3</li>
                                        <li>bay with window on level 3 + bay with window on level 1 & 2</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Instead of using the same 2-bay module, we could add some variations by mixing four different 2-bay models. See image
                                    below for some samples from Option E. It uses the same pattern and logic as Option D but by providing variations for the
                                    2-bay module, the layouts were more dynamic and less rigorous.</p>

                                    <p>Due to the time limitation of this project, studies of other multi-bay modules were not performed. If this approach
                                    seemed to be appropriate, analyzing and studying other multi-bay modules would be a good next step for continued
                                    analysis.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
                                    <p>The objective of this project is to determine optimized building façade layout options, incorporating performance
                                    requirements and aesthetic preferences. Through the analysis and the application of discrete mathematics, specifically
                                    combinations and probabilities, several valid layout options were explored and identified.</p>
                                    <p><h4>Weakness, Limitations, Future Exploration</h4></p>
                                    <p>One of the major limitations encountered in this project was the computational feasibility of evaluating all possible
                                    combinations of façade layouts. Transitioning from 113 valid vertical options to a 42-bay façade layout, the sheer
                                    volume of permutations made it impractical to evaluate every option. In addition, the methods utilized provided valid
                                    directions but due to time constraint they do not cover all possible options. It requires further analysis, exploration
                                    and evaluation based on designers’ and clients’ preferences.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, I began this project by dividing the building façade into vertical bays. However, another approach worth
                                    exploring would be to start the analysis by determining the window locations based on the requirements and then
                                    assigning different panels to the solid portions of the wall. This method could offer a different perspective and
                                    potentially yield alternative optimal solutions.</p>
                                    <p>In the future, I would like to learn more about computational methods or algorithms that can more efficiently generate,
                                    evaluate, and optimize large-scale options. Delving deeper into the realms of computational optimization methods and
                                    algorithms could potentially offer alternative perspectives and solutions to these complex problems. Additionally, the
                                    potential application of AI and machine learning could provide more innovative approaches to architectural design
                                    problems.</p>
                                    <!-- <p><h4>Personal Learning</h4></p>
                                    <p>This project provides me an opportunity to address an architectural problem in a more systematic way. I have learned
                                    about using combinations and permutations in Python, as well as using Matplotlib for data visualization. It also
                                    introduced me to Jupyter Notebook, which provided another way to write code and document process. The final report
                                    provides a good opportunity to reflect on the project. As I gain more computer science knowledge, I look forward to
                                    revisiting the problem and developing better solutions.</p> -->
